# Digit-Recognition

## Overview
In this project we train neural network to identify the digits from the [MNIST data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). It is a simple feed forward neural network with back propogation. The dataset can be obtained in the IDX file format for MNIST digits from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 

## Principles Used 
Here a feed forward neural network has been implemented. At the heart of every neural network are small units called perceptrons. The following displays a perceptron unit.
